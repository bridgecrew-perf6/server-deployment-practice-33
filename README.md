# My Notes
learned about those handlers hells which I never heard of.Added some new information about test-driven development (TDD), continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD).
continued to go into the describe function and the "It" and what I found the most interesting Supertest and how it fakes a server to carry out a test.
